# iap-tools-java
A Java toolkit for working with the IAP network protocol and its data format ION.

IAP is a network protocol intended to replace HTTP, and possibly other protocols too.

IAP uses of a common message format (encoded using ION). This common message format can
be used to transport messages from a set of semantic protocols. Semantic protocols are
sub-protocols of IAP (protocols within IAP).

ION can be used as a separate data format. It is very flexible, compact and fast.
You can use ION with IAP, with HTTP (instead of e.g. JSON), and also in log files
and data files.
